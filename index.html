                    <p><strong>How we do it:</strong> We produce events with compassionate, talented artists, that generate revenue. Then we distribute that revenue, in the form of basic necessities, children's toys, and cash, to families who need it.</p>
                    <p>We believe that <strong>money is the best cure for poverty</strong>. We don't need to monitor the gifts we give or ensure "accountability." <strong>Families are their own best judges of how to use the help we give them</strong>. We trust them. No strings attached.</p>
                    <p>That said, we're lucky to have partners who connect us to families that are positioned to use our help effectively. <strong><a href="#">Onward Neighborhood House</a></strong> has been our partner in that regard for nearly a decade.</p>
                    <p>Since our first events nearly twenty years ago, we have raised <strong>over two million dollars</strong> and reached <strong>over one thousand people</strong>. In 2019, we will do our farrest- and deepest-reaching programs yet.</p>
